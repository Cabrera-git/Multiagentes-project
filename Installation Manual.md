## Instructions
In order to utilize this model, you first need to download the code found within this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cabrera-git/Multiagentes-project). You can do this by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button and then clicking "Download ZIP". Once you have downloaded the code, you can extract the files to a folder of your choice.

In order to run the model, you will need to have Pyhton 3.10 or later. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once this is done, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this by opening a terminal in the project's folder and running the following commands:

```cd MesaModels/```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Once this is done, you can run the model by running the following command:

```python api.py```

This will open the server with the model, which will be initialized by running the Unity executable contained within the project's folder.

You can now enjoy viewing the model in 3D!
